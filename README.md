# UT Austin Data Analytics Certificate, Course 1 Task 1 (Investigate Customer Buying Patterns) 
With RapidMiner


As CTO and head of Blackwell's eCommerce Team, I'd like to welcome you aboard. I'm excited to get started on this project, but I'd first like to give you a bit of background to get you up to speed. Blackwell has been a successful electronics retailer for over 40 years, with over 30 stores in the Southeast. A little over a year ago we launched our eCommerce website. We are starting to build up customer transaction data from the site and we want to leverage this data to inform our decisions about site-related activities, like online marketing, enhancements to the site and so on, in order to continue to maximize the amount of revenue we generate from eCommerce sales.

For example, our VP of Sales, Martin Goodrich, thinks that customers who shop in the store are older than customers who shop online and that older people spend more money on electronics than younger people. He is considering some marketing activities and potentially some design changes to the website to attract older buyers. I, on the other hand, believe that the differences in transactions and customer demographics may be regional. Before we even consider any additional activities related to the website, we want to gain insight into any factors that can explain how our customers shop and how much they spend.

To that end, I would like you to explore the customer transaction data we have collected from recent online and in-store sales and see if you can infer any insights about customer purchasing behavior. Specifically, I am interested in the following:

Do customers in different regions spend more per transaction? Which regions spend the most/least?
Are there differences in the age of customers between regions? If so, can we predict the age of a customer in a region based on other demographic data?
We need to investigate Martin’s hypothesis: Is there any correlation between age of a customer and if the transaction was made online or in the store? Do any other factors predict if a customer will buy online or in our stores?
Finally, is there a relationship between number of items purchased and amount spent?
To investigate this, I’d like you to use data mining methods to explore the data, look for patterns in the data and draw conclusions. I have attached a data file of customer transactions; it includes some information about the customer who made the transaction, as well as the amount of the transaction, and how many items were purchased. Once you have completed your analysis, please create a brief report of your findings and conclusions and an explanation of how you arrived at those conclusions so I can discuss them with Martin.

Thanks,
Danielle
